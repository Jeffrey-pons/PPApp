      <h2>MACHINE HALLUCINATION par Refik Anadol Studio</h2>
      <p>
        La question de savoir pourquoi nous collectionnons, enregistrons et
        partageons nos expériences quotidiennes a toujours été liée aux
        préoccupations formelles et esthétiques concernant la représentation de
        la réalité, de la totalité et de la profondeur de l'imagination humaine.
        Stéphane Mallarmé, poète et critique du XIXe siècle, a dit que tout ce
        qui existe dans le monde existe pour finir dans un livre....

        MACHINE HALLUCINATIONS — NATURE DREAMS, designed specifically for KÖNIG
        GALERIE, comprises three novel aesthetic approaches to a vast
        photographic dataset of nature: A giant data sculpture displaying
        machine-generated, dynamic pigments of nature titled NATURE DREAMS, four
        new series of data paintings, and WINDS OF BERLIN, a site-specific,
        public art projection on the tower of ST. AGNES which will be created
        based on environmental real-time data collected from the city.

        Anadol is a pioneer in the world of rare digital art and crypto
        collectibles, minting the first fully immersive digital artwork NFT in
        September 2021. For KÖNIG GALERIE he creates unique NFT options: the AI
        data sculpture NATURE DREAMS, and his public projection, WINDS OF
        BERLIN, which will mark the first time a generative public artwork in
        Berlin to be offered in NFT form.

        An architectural exhibition of synesthetic reality experiments based on
        GAN algorithms developed by artificial intelligence and inspired by
        fluid dynamics, NATURE DREAMS turns datasets into latent multi-sensory
        experiences to commemorate the beauty of the earth we share.
      </p>
      <p>
        The exhibition’s eponymous, sublime AI Data Sculpture, Nature Dreams
        utilizes over 300 million publicly available photographs of nature
        collected between 2018- 2021 at Refik Anadol Studio. Combined, this
        represents the largest raw dataset of nature ever gathered for an
        artwork, which was then used to train a GAN AI algorithm. The resulting
        AI Data Painting incorporates pigments, shapes, and patterns that we
        associate with nature, but only exist in the mind of a machine as
        dreams. Each variation features a stunning visual interpretation,
        together forming a multi- faceted reflection of the nuanced relationship
        between technology, humanity, and culture. With the assistance of the
        Google AI Quantum team, Anadol was granted access to one of the world’s
        foremost quantum computing research projects all- owing him to merge
        AI-induced latent space with a quantum hyperspace, and thus speculate an
        alternative reality through the lens of nature aesthetics.
